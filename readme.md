Phase 5 Project - SurgiCheck

A user must login to preform any actions or see any information. A sign up is located on the login page for users without a login. Username must be unique in addition to passwords being atleast 8 characters long.

Once logged in the user is able to add a patient and then is transported to patient list. A search bar is avaiable at the top of the page which enables the patient list to be searched through by patient name or mrn.

A user is able to see a list of all patients(name, mrn, dob and the procedure (name and attending surgeon only)) and then select the patient to see that particular patient's information (personal information, procedure details, and the checklist). Once patient is selected the user is able to update and delete the individual patient in addition to updating individual checklist and/or procedure details. 

In the admin section a user is able to add a new surgeon to post a procedure. A user can also see a list of surgeons (procedures) in which they are able to search through the list quickly via a search bar using surgeon name or service line. From there once selected the user will be sent to the individual procedure page where they can view all the information for that procedure.
